    #%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    # rfr builds a randomer classification forest structure made up of a list
    # of trees.  This forest is randomer because each node is rotated before 
    # being split (as described by Tyler Tomita).  Each tree is made of nodes
    # which are numbered from left to right within a particular level (depth)
    # of a tree.  The loop over nodes when considering splits is made in the
    # same order as the numbering of the nodes. That is, nodes are traversed
    # across a single level from left to right then moves to the left-most node
    # of the next level.
    #
    #  INPUT:
    #
    # X is an n-by-p matrix, where rows represent observations and columns
    # represent features
    #
    # Y is an n-by-1 array of integer class labels. Unique class labels
    # must be contiguous and start from 1 (e.g. [0,1,2] is not okay;
    # neither is [1,3,4])
    #
    # MinParent is an integer specifying the minimum number of observations
    # a node must have in order for an attempt to split to be made.  Lower
    # values may lead to overtraining and increased training time.
    #
    # trees is the number of trees that will be in the forest.
    #
    # MaxDepth is the maximum depth that a tree can grow to.  If set to "inf"
    # then there is no maximum depth.  If set to 0 then a maximum depth is
    # calculated based on the number of classes and number of samples provided.
    #
    # bagging is the percentage of training data to withhold during each
    # training iteration.  If set to 0 then the entire training set is used
    # during every iteration.  The withheld portion of the training data
    # is used to calculate OOB error for the tree.
    #
    # ClassCt is the number of different classes in Y.  It is calculated 
    # in the calling function to prevent recalculation by each forked function 
    # when in parallel.
    #
    # FUN is the function used to create the projection matrix.  The matrix
    # returned by this function should be a p-by-u matrix where p is the
    # number of columns in the input matrix X and u is any integer > 0.
    # u can also vary from node to node.
    #
    # options is a list of inputs to the user provided projection matrix
    # creation function -- FUN.
    #
    # COOB is a boolean that determines whether or not OOB error is calculated.
    # If bagging equals zero then COOB is ignored.  If bagging does not equal 
    # zero and COOB is TRUE then OOB is calculated and printed to the screen.
    #
    # Progress is a boolean.  When true a progress marker is printed to the 
    # screen every time a tree is grown.  This is useful for large input.
    #
    # OUTPUT:
    #
    # A forest construct made up of trees.  This forest can be used to make 
    # predictions on new inputs.  When COOB=TRUE then the output is a list
    # containing $forest and $OOBmat.  $forest is the forest structure and
    # OOBmat is the OOB error for each tree.
